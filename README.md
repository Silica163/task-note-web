# task-note-web
An application like "google keep".

## Why I write this program?
At first, I want to learn a new programming language, in this case is php.
Before I start this project, I use ssh to view and edit my notes in main computer,
but it isn't work well because I must ssh every time I want to take a little note.
So I desided to write something for take a note, and this is the result.

## What does I use?
php html css javascript json

## goal 
1. todo-list
2. note
